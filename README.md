# ShroomRoom

## A mushroom-based recipe and information application

## About

### Background

The internet provides a multitude of recipes for just about any type of cooking, and mushrooms are no exception.  However, as someone who cooks a variety of different mushroom based recipes on a regular basis, there ceases to be any sort of mushroom oriented website specializing  in fungi-based culinary endeavors and information.  This application aims to provide the users with a single platform for finding mushroom oriented recipes, detailed information about specific mushrooms, and information on foraging and collecting different mushroom species.
### Features
- Create/Edit/Delete recipes
- Upload images
- Comments and rating feature
- Rating average calculated and displayed
- Mushroom tags that take you to information on specific mushroom
- Filtered recipe pages based on mushroom tags
- Foraging Tips and information with links to external resources
